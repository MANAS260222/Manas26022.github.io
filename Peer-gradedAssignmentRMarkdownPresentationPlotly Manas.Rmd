```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```(r)
#This is a graph and plot that shows the relationship between sepal and petal length in the iris dataset
```
```{r}
library(plotly)
```
```{r}
summary(iris)
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plant <- plot_ly(data = iris, x = ~Sepal.Length,y = ~Petal.Length)
plant
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
